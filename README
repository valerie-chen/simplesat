Basic SAT Solver using Two Watch Literals
Project Owner: Valerie Chen (vc284)

I owe much to the following resources in helping me understand the concept of watched literals: 
- http://www.gecode.org/events/acp-summerschool-2011/slides/Gent/SATCP3.pdf
- https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/publication/DAC2001v56.pdf (referred to me by Lucas Paul, a fellow student)

To run the SAT solver:

OR
“Python src/satsolver.py file”
